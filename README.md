## Wait so just WTF is this?
Reiwious is an unofficial patch for IW4x that attempts to prevent IW4x crashes in order to provide a more enjoyable experience.



## Usage ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
* Download the latest release from [here](https://www.github.com/Wiizard/Reiwious/releases/latest).
* Baptise the almighty Reiwious before running it.
* Bestow the soul of your IW4x installation and cleanse it with Reiwious.
* Relax while you succumb to your new shiny IW4x.
* Once Reiwious is installed, rub the ol' genie lamp and play with your new god tier waifu.
* Profit?



## So does Reiwious make IW4x god tier waifu then? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
You decide but from a gaming perspective, it just works.



## Parting Words
* Reiwious is not official, endorsed or developed by any of the IW4x developers; this patch was made by fans of the client in order to have a better experience.
* This patch could of been (and still can be) done by anyone, it wasn't rocket science :p
